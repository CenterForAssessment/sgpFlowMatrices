This is the initial release of the **sgpFlowMatrices** package. The package **sgpFlowMatrices** contains sgpFlow coefficient matrices derived from SGP analyses of large scale state assessment data. The coefficient matrices (either single-cohort or super-cohort) are utilized by functions within the SGP package to calculate percentile growth trajectories via the `sgpFlow` package as well as baseline referenced projections. The package is under active
development by staff at the [Center for Assessment](https://www.nciea.org).

For complete `sgpFlowMatrices` documentation, see the [documentation](https://CenterForAssessment.github.io/sgpFlowMatrices/reference/sgpFlowMatrices.html)
